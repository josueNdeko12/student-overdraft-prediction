# Student Overdraft Prediction

This project was developed for the **CSCI 3900 - Data Science and Machine Learning** course. It aims to predict whether a student has ever overdrawn a checking account using features such as **Age**, **Gender**, and **DaysDrink** (alcohol consumption frequency).

The dataset consists of 450 student records and includes both categorical and numerical features. Several classification models were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective predictor.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset `Project_Data.csv` contains the following columns:
- `Gender` (categorical)
- `Age` (numerical)
- `DaysDrink` (numerical)
- `Overdrawn` (target label)

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

- Removed rows with missing values.
- Replaced inconsistent gender labels (`M` → `Male`, `F` → `Female`).
- Encoded the `Gender` column using one-hot encoding.
- Detected and handled outliers in the `DaysDrink` column.
- Split the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing.
- Final features used: `Gender_Male`, `Gender_Female`, `Age`, `DaysDrink`

## 🧠 Models Trained

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## 📊 Evaluation Results

| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 78.95%   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 78.95%   |
| Decision Tree       | 64.91%   |
| Random Forest       | 56.14%   |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | **85.96%** |

The **Support Vector Machine** (SVM) model outperformed all others and was selected as the best model for this classification task.
